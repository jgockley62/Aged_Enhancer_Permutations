#Denna's Enhancer Permutation 
##From Denna:
#There are 5 enhancer age groups: Eutheria, Theria, Mammalia, Amniota, Older_than_Amniota

#Everything is in this folder: /home/de77/Cortex_Enhancer_Shuffle_for_PNAS

#There are 3 bed files for each age group: one for whole enhancers, one for cores, and one with both 
#(e.g. Eutheria_enhancers_CS23.bed, Eutheria_cores.bed, Eutheria_enhancers_cores.bed). 
#Enhancer file is bed file with 4th column as enhancer name; core file is bed file with 4th column as core age, 5th column as enhancer name; enhancer_core file has first 4 columns for cores, last 4 columns for whole enhancer and 8th column is enhancer name).

#For the intersection of enhancers with phastCons elements:
#intersectBed -c -a /home/de77/Cortex_Enhancer_Shuffle_for_PNAS/Eutheria_enhancers_CS23.bed -b /home/de77/Cortex_Enhancer_Shuffle_for_PNAS/phastCons_elements.bed > /home/de77/Cortex_Enhancer_Shuffle_for_PNAS/Eutheria_enhancers_phastCons.bed 

#enhancers_phastCons.bed results file is bed file for enhancer, 4th column is enhancer name, 5th column is number of phastCons elements in enhancer.

#For the intersection of cores with phastCons elements:
#intersectBed -c -a /home/de77/Cortex_Enhancer_Shuffle_for_PNAS/Eutheria_cores.bed -b /home/de77/Cortex_Enhancer_Shuffle_for_PNAS/phastCons_elements.bed > /home/de77/Cortex_Enhancer_Shuffle_for_PNAS/Eutheria_cores_phastCons.bed 

#cores_phastCons.bed results file is bed file for core, 4th column is core age, 5th column is enhancer name, 6th column is number of phastCons elements in core.

#exclude promoters and exons in shuffles:
#/home/jl56/GENOME/Ensembl/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.promoter.bed  /home/jl56/GENOME/Ensembl/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.exon.bed
